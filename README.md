# InteractiveForm
In this project, I JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional conference called "FullStack Conf."

Using the JavaScript jQuery library I added interactivity to supplied HTML to make the form more user-friendly. I also added additional CSS styling.

With jQuery I added customized and conditional behavior and interactivity to validate user input and provide helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.
