# InteractiveForm
In this project, I use JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional conference called "FullStack Conf"

Using the jQuery library I added interactivity to supplied HTML & CSS to make the form more user-friendly. I also added additional CSS styling for overall theme and Tooltips.

With jQuery I added customized and conditional behavior and interactivity to validate user input and provide helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields. I also customized a confirmation message to be sent on successful form submission.
